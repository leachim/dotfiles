#The first step is to optionally fill the disk with random data, which is a good practice if it is likely that someone knowledgable is actually going to crack your encrypted data.  
#The downside is that it can take a long time if the partition is large.  
#For example, filling a 500 GB partition over a SATA II connection with a relatively fast CPU takes over 24 hours.  
#If you donâ€™t have the time you can simply skip this step.  The worst part of the process is that there is no progress indicator, so you just wait for it to finish.

#--cipher sets the cipher to be used by the encryption.  
#--key-size sets the encrypted key size.  256 is twice the default of 128. 
#--verify-passphrase causes luksFormat to ask for a passphrase twice, which is a good idea when formating to avoid typos.  luksFormat formats the partition /dev/sdb.

#Now that the partition has been formated, we need to open it up and create an ext4 partition inside it.

#luksOpen will create a device under /dev/mapper named encr-sdb that we can use to access our encrypted partition.  To facilitate easy mounting of the container we can create an entry in fstab.

#/dev/mapper/encr-sdb        /mnt/encr-sdb       ext4            user,noauto             0       0
#You can, of course, use any options that you desire in your fstab entry.  In the future, to connect to the encrypted container, the following commands must be run.

#cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb encr-sdb
#mount /dev/mapper/encr-sdb 
#luksOpen will prompt you for your password before proceeding.  To disconnect from the encrypted container, undo the commands in reverse.

#umount /dev/mapper/encr-sdb
#cryptsetup luksClose encr-sdb
#These commands can be scripted to facilitate easy access.
